Just a working title. Mainly playing around with LOVE and Lua.

cult of a lunatic god, a permanent eclipse which has blotted out the light of the sun 
itself.

# What did I do?
Made a retro fantasy RPG.

# Why did I design that way?
Used the StateMachine paradigm because it seemed the most logical way to organize the different states
that an RPG goes through.

# What is contained in each file?
Every state is organized under the State folder. All art and music is in assets. And data that could be serialized is in
the data folder. Everything else is a main or class file.

# What setup is required?
Love 11.5.

# How does one run the application?
Run using the love.exe. I set it up to run from the command line.
